## Short description
### What's the problem?
The sentiment analysis of Indians after the extension of lockdown announcements to be analysed with the relevant #tags on twitter and build a predictive analytics model to understand the behaviour of people if the lockdown is further extended.
Also develop a dashboard with visualization of people reaction to the govt announcements on lockdown extension.

### The idea
For building the solution I am taking input from the user on how they will react on lockdown extension and saving the response of user after that predicting the most likely outcome from them. 
Also, I have taken the #tags from the twitter and build a analytics dashboard using dash showing the variations in number of #tags so as to predict the outcome with greater accuracy.
On the other hand, I have built a analysis graph using matplotlib which shows how many people are having which type of emotion. 
For understanding the sentiment of people on government decision to extend the lockdown. I have built a dashboard based on three emotions i.e. angry, trust, neutral. In this dashboard user can choose the respective state of India and see how many percentages of people are having these three emotions and can see the pie chart representation of that.

## The architecture
1.	The user navigates to the site and save the response. 
2.	The user then can predict the most likely outcome of all the responses saved. 
3.	After that, user can open the twitter analysis of COVID-19 tweets. 
4.	The user can now open the dashboard and see the pie chart visualization of all the states of India. 


## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
install python 3.6
install Visual Studio Code
```
### Python libraries
```
Pip install matplotlib
Pip install flask
Pip install pandas
Pip install flask_mysqldb
Pip install yaml
Pip install plotly
Pip install dash
```

## Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
Say what the step will be, for example
```
Mkdir folder
python -m venv myenv
pip install virtualenv
Python main.py
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```
```
And repeat
curl localhost:3000
```
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Live demo
You can find a running system to test at callforcode.mybluemix.net

## Built with
- Flask_mysqldb â€“ The MySQL database used. 
- Flask and Dash- The web framework used
-	Twitter - Used to collect hashtags.
